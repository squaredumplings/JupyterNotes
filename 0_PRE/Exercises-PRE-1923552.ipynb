    "# Programming Lesson and Exercises - PRE\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these exercises is to teach you the use of _Python 3_ in the context of _Data Analytics_. These programming lessons do not require prior programming experience. If you do have experience with programming in Python then you may find some exercises rather easy, so consider them as a refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first part introduces the concepts for this week. The theory is interleaved with small exercises, which have the goal of letting you practice the concepts that were just intruduced.\n",
    "- At the end there are one or more larger exercises, which have the goal to test what you have learned earlier. These will be more difficult and will require more independent work than the exercises in the first part.\n",
    "\n",
    "All exercises can be solved with the concepts that were introduced earlier. Since there are often more than one correct way to solve a programming problem, we try to accept various correct anwers. However, many of the automatic tests in Momotor (see _How to submit your work_ below) assume that your answers are constructed using the concepts introduced in these notebooks. If you look for answers on the Internet (e.g. if you import other libraries) you run the risk that your answers will be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the small exercises can be solved by copy-pasting code from the examples. However, it is up to you to try to solve the exercises yourself, which will help you learn, before copy-pasting the answers. The ease of looking up answers is meant to provide guidance when you get stuck, especially for those of you who are new to programming.\n",

    "A program is a precise description of how to manipulate data. Just like a recipe for cooking a dish, a program consists of a sequence of instructions that precisely describe to a machine the steps it should perform in order to achieve a certain goal. The basic instructions to manipulate data include instructions to:\n",

    "    (e.g. combining it with other data, such as adding two numbers);\n",

    "    (e.g. to use it in an expression);\n",
    "* **output** data to the external world\n",
    "    (e.g. show it on the screen, print it on paper, set the speed of a motor, write it to an external file).\n",

A function has a *name*, it takes zero or more *arguments* and returns zero or more *return values*. Functions are called by specifying the function name and providing values for the arguments in brackets. For example, `sum(x)` calls the function with the name `sum`, with one argument `x`, and returns a number representing the sum of all elements in the list `x`. The following example sums up the elements in the list `[1, 5, -3, 4.2]`:"
